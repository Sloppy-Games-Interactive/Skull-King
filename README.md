## How to Play:

Skull King is a trick-taking game played with a standard deck of cards. The objective is to accurately predict the number of tricks you will win each round. However, beware of the Skull King, as it can either earn you bonus points or lead to disaster!

1. **Setup:** Decide on the number of rounds to play and the scoring system.

2. **Dealing:** Each player is dealt a hand of cards.

3. **Bidding:** Players predict the number of tricks they will win in the round.

4. **Gameplay:** Play cards in turn, following suit if possible. The highest card of the leading suit wins the trick, unless a pirate or the Skull King is played.

5. **Scoring:** Points are awarded based on successful bids and penalties are applied for failed bids.

6. **Winning:** The player with the highest score at the end of the predetermined number of rounds wins the game.
